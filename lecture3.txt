Lecture 3: Scientific Method
============================

Review:  Sensations, Induction, Theory Ladeness

- Some theories are better than others
    - what makes one theory better than another

What is acceptance?

Acceptance = a theory is said to be accepted if its the best available description of its object
Use = a theory is used when it as a practical application
Pursuit = worthy of further development (WE'RE LIVING IN THE SIMULATION)

depending on where you lie in time, different theories are in the different categories of Acceptance, Use, Pursuit

Pursuit - difficult to speak about since you can't tell whats going to be in the future
Use - tools in the toolbox, not whats accepted/not accepted, just adding more tools (eng approach)

Acceptance - cannot accept multiple theories, just ONE best one
    - question is how do we decided which is the best?

** Theory Assessment **
    - the method of apprasial to determine which theory is better with the current evidence
        - Scientific Method

Method =  a set of requirements for employment in theory assessment
Methods should not be confused with methodology = which is EXPLICIT requirements
    - instead method is the actual expectations of the scientific community / methodology are the rules prescribed by the community as the correct way of doing science

Research Technique = how people come up with ideas (group brainstorm)

Current Scientific Method: Does a new theory try to modify the accepted ontology

If No: in order to become accepted the new theory must fit the known data with more precision and accuracy than accepted theory

If Yes: In order to become accepted the new theory must also provide confirmation predictions of hitherto unobserved phenomena

Sometimes we are okay with accuracy and prediction

Hypothetic-Deductive method - a hypothesis is allowed to assume something as long as it predicts something novel, and smore of these novel predictions are confirmed
    - question: is this method unchangeable? (NO)

(1600s)
A proposition or theory would be acceptable if: 
    1. it grasps the nature of a thing through intuition
    2. It it was proven inductivley

People could send a theory but if it did not seem intuitivly true they would not want to listen to your theories
Decarte wanted to created a system that would satisify the Aristitlian community at the time
    - tore it down and built it from the ground up using their theories

Summary 

Method: Static vs Dynamic
Is there an unchangable method of science?
    Yes, Static Method thesis: the method of science is unchangeable
    No, Dynamic Method Thesis: there is no unchangeable method of science

There is no fixed method of science even though many people in history have believed there were specific rules

Scietnfic Mosiac = a set of accepted theories and employed methods

Question: If there are no fixed methods of theory evaluation, does it mean that the process of scientific change is irrational?

Next Time: Mechanism of Scientific Change
