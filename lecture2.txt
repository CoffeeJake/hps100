Lecture 2: Absolute Knowledge
==============================

- scientific theories change over time (along with every discipline)
- the question is anything ** Unchangeable **
- Is there ** Absolute ** knowledge

Case 1: Mathematics
    - prop: (1 + 2 = 3)
    - what makes this prop true
    - proving through definitions
    - dont need experience/observations

Case 2: Swans
    - prop: all swans are white
    - Swans A,B,C are white therefore all swans are white
    - based on our individual experience of white swans

Case 3: Gravity
    - explains the Law of Gravity, force of attraction between two objects
    - how do we justify this law, this is either similar to case1 or case2
    - closer to Case 2: Swans
    - go out an observe a falling apple, waterfall and the earth

Analytic Propositions - deducible from definitions, can NEVER contridict
    - ie a bachalor who is married can never exist (impossible)
    - cannot concieve of a world where this is not the case?
    - math example

Synthetic Propositions - not deducible from definitions
    - can contridict each other
    - can easily concieve of a world where this is not the case for gravity
    - another example is Law of Diminishing Returns (not always true for return per unit)
    - swans / gravity here
    - can easily think of a world with different biological laws like Dragons 

Can analytic propositions be absolutely certain?
    - Answer: Yes, since things are true through definitions
    - nothing can challenge this

Synthetic Props - all object p's have property q
    - have to observe this
    - yet we cannot be abosolutly certain
    - Answer: No, synthetic props cannot be absolutely certain

    Problem 1: Sensations
        - Swans exist in reality
        - now swans in the brain, sensations of swans (as I see them)
        - how can we ever be sure of the things we precieve to be reality
        - to check we have to confirm through other sensations, but this in lies a problem
        - holy shit this is boring,  kids are just trying to disprove him
        - we are in no position to be able to trust our senses

    Problem 2: Induction
        - suppose we can trust our sensations
        - how can we ever arrive at an inductive conclusion if we only sense things in singular objects
        - individual -> general = induction
        - in the future whatever swan i observe will be white
        - PROBLEM: there is always a chance there will be a black swan, 
            - even if you have covered ALL existing swans, does that mean future swans cant be black? NO
        - will never be in a position to study all planets
        - can make no gaurentees

    Problem 3: Theory-Ladenness
        - theories that layer ontop of theories
        - trusting a telescope to see into space, trusting the optics created by scientists
        - see an apple? again accepting sensations produced under proper illumination, being sober
        - we rely on basic animal like physiology

Summary:
Problem of Sensations - senses arent 100% trustworthy
Problem of Induction - no matter how many time observed
Problem of Theory Ladness - theories relying on theries

Infalliblism to Fallibilism
