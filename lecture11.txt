Lecture 11: Worldviews: Metaphysical Components
===============================================

Metaphysics = a set of views about the world taken as a whole
    - can matter exist without matter (vice verse)
    - what are the essential properties of matter
    - is space a substance? can there be empty space?
    - does God exist?
    - is the universe hmogoenous or hterogeneous
    - strictly determined?

Ultimate Question of life, the universe, and everything: 42

Metaphysical assumptions - may NOT be explicitly stated
    - in past mosiacs BEFORE Newtonian - assumptions were explicit
    - During Newton and onward assumptions were implicit not explicit

Newtonian Metaphysics
    - Action at a Distance - part of many theories
        - law of gravity
        - coulombs law

    - Dynamism - matter is an extended substance interacting through forces
    - Probabilistic Determinism
        - if you accept quantum physics
            - you accept prob determinism
            - other theories do this too genetics, economics

What can alter Metaphysics

3 discoveries, which one can change our metaphysics
    1. some dino fossil
    2. a precambrian rabbit
    3. genuine angel fossil

A worldview can be altered only when a new theory is introduced and accepted and changes metaphysics assumptions

an individual discovery cannot alter anything unless its a novel prediction of a new theory

Debunking Myths of Science history
==================================
    - began in the 17th century, Newton
        - people in the future will no longer think our science is REAL science

    - Galileo was a maryr of science who fought the clergy
        - the clergy was represented of the current view of the time
        - galileo was a future looker
            - it didnt have to do with the mosiacs of the time
            - method of the time was different

    - scientific revolution liberated science from religion
        - theology remained part of the mosaic until the 20th century 

    - god does not exsist
        - contemproary science doesnt say he doesnt exist, just implies agnosticism

    - contmp science is independant from any metaphyics 
        - many metaphysical assumptions are implicit and unaviodable

    - science proves its theories be experiments and observations
        - emperical science verifies, and science has not always used them

    - the method of science is universal and unchangeable
        - different methods of science, no such thing at a perfect method
        - due to fallisim

    - science is a rational enterprise because of its universal method
        - what we make science rational is that it obeys a set of laws
        - laws that change

    - each theory contains more and more true claims
        - claim can only be partiall true and partially false
        - we are in no position to say something is strictly ture or strictly false

    - strict line between science and pseudoscience
        - the criteria of demarcation between scientific and non-scientific theories are changeable
