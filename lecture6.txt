Lecture 6: Science and Non Science
==================================

The general question is: Whats the difference between science and non science
    - what are the characteristics of a scientific theory
    
Theories: Scientific vs Uncientific:
    - scientific: history / general reletivity (also includes unaccepted theories)
    - unscientific: witchcraft

"Any nonsense can be based on experience"
    - very vague and it allows you to cherry pick your data
    - just to look for a specific link

Based on experience is not a good reason

Demarcation Criteria = scientific if it explains all known facts, explains by and large the given domain
    - this is not good because many unscientific theories that explain everything
        - astrology is a good example
            - post hoc explinations are always possible after the fact
            - make predictions so vague that it will always work
    - AND it is testable at least in principal
        - it is not nessacary for it to be tested
            - just possible to be tested
        - it changes with the times depending on current scientific theories

    IF we apply OUR current theories to old mosaics of the past, often we will find theories that are now un scientific

    - we have to prepare for scienticetists of the future to brush off our current methods
        - yet we must understand that science of the past must not be dismissed

Therefore Demarcation Criteria is changeable!
    - no permenant crtieria(scientific one time in history, but unsientific in other times)

Methods = Acceptance Criteria + Compatibility Criteria + Demarcation Criteria

The question still remains what distinguishes science from non-science
    - shift from theories TO processs of the changing of the scientific mosaic
    - any violation of the scientific laws, we can intuitivley say that it is inheriently un scientific

4 Examples: One for each of the 4 laws 

    Case 1: the lost manuscript
        - a lost manuscript with all the answers
        - if lost parts of science is lost, and NOT REPLACED

    Case 2: Lysenkoism
        - traits gained during life could be passed on to children
        - if you work hard, you can change the life of the future generations
            - just persecutre people that disagree, people believed above ^
            - this is unscientific because a theory gets into mosaic, WITHOUT satisfying methods of the time
            - specifically in this case the genetic studies
            - violates 2nd law of sci change

    Case 3: Homeopathy - treatement of diseases through small amounts(flu shots)
        - double blind trial
        - try to convince us to relay on testimonials
            - for this to work it would need to replace the double blind trial methods
        - it would be a method that would be deployed that violates the the thrid law
        - method allows you to cherrypick (20 people who claimed this hangover cure works)

    Case 4: Astrology - astrological configurations are still in effect
        - suppose it somehow became accepted
        - would introduce INCOMPATIBILITY into the mosaiac
        - violation of the 0th law

Idea is that any actual violation of the laws of scientific change is inheriently unscientific
