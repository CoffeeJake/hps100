Lecture 9: Newtonian Worldview
=============================

Newton was legendary: knew the Laws of Nature (semi-devine)

Newtonian Myths
    - liberated itself from religion
    - completely rejected astrology
    - united terrestrial and celestial physics
    - "opened up" the closed/finite universe
    - scientific method was first employed in Newtonian science

Theology - study of god and the relations between God mankind and the universe
    - Revealed Theology - inferring God's existance through God's acts of self-revelation
    - Natural Theology - inferring God's existance through the natural world around you

Astrology - concered with the influences of the stars and planets upon terrestrial affairs
    - Natural Astrology - concerened with celestial influences upon natural things
    - Judicial Astrology - concered with celestiral affairs upon human affairs

Aristotelian Cosmology - 4 terrestrial elements but celestial region is made of aether (different laws)
Newtonian Space - emptiness in which matter exsits (space as independent void)(4 laws)
    - 2nd law - acceleration of the body has to do with force/massSpace
        - yet Decartes did it first (any spatial boundry)

Newton ignored Cartesian science and so does popular media
    - Cartesian did many of those myths above before Newton
    - otherwise their views were farily similar

- You can never have Resistance of 0 - therefore there can be no true empty space

- experimentally a vaccum can exist
    - space is a stage for material objects, there can be space deviod of matter (vaccum)
    - if matter disappeared then there would still be a stage

*1st Difference: Vaccum*

Action at a Distance
*2nd Difference: Forces*
    - changes in Decartes its done through contact whereas in Newtons its through force
    - example is gravity acting at a distance without a mediator
    - matter is an extended substance acting through forces

Magnests attract and repel as a force
Magnetic force like gravity acts at a distance

3rd Dynaminsim

Newton and Cartesians agree on Dualism (matter and mind)

Hypothetico-Deductive Method
    - Dynamic Matter
        1. Any thing happens between interacting particles
            1. Complexity - fundamental inner mechanicsms
            2. Post - Hoc explinations

Lead to a HD method that includes unobservable entities
