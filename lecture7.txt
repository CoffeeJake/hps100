Lecture 7: Aristotelian-Medieval Worldview
==========================================

Why study the world views of the past?
    - it shows us we can have genuine science with a different method

What was the mosaic? (accepted until the end of the 17th century)

Aristotelian Physics
4 Elements:
    - Hot
    - Cold
    - Dry
    - Wet

Transformability = changing these traits = alchamy

4 Humors have symetry with the 4 humors 

each combo has to do with a different temperment

Cosmology

Natural Motion: Aether - tends to move in circles around the centre of the universe
Immutability of Aether: Aether cannot transform to any other element

Clear cut cases of something celestial dealing with something terrestrial 
    - it is reasonable to study because the casual connections between the celestial and the terrestial regions

**Astrology**
    - individual sign is determined by the position of the sun during your birth
    - each sign was associated with one of the four elements
    - doctors were expected to know their astrology
        - because 
    - Health = Balance != Disease = Imbalance
    - to cure = to restore the balance 
    - and an individual balance of humors is determined by the specific placement of planets

*The Aristotelian-Medieval Method*
    - a prop is acceptable if it grasps the nature of a thing

a thing has its nature which makes a thing what is it. The human mind once it has experience
    - it can grasp the nature of a thing

- used to believe a clear cut definition between a natural things(comes from within) vs a artificial thing (has a source of chance in something external)

No space for experimentation, in this medievial worldview due to an experiment being un-natural

Quantitative vs Qualitative change (we no longer believe there is no change that cannot be expressed in mathematics)

during thise time mathematics had is inapplicable to instances of qualitative change

The elements of this time are interconnected at the time
    - even we cannot replicated how interconnected the aristotelian science existed
