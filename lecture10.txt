Lecture 10: Contemporary Worldview
=================================

Worldviews are appriciated after a period of time after they crystalize

Neuroscience - anything we think has to be connected to some level of the brain
    - we do not quite understand yet
    - one thing we accept that anything that happens at that high level
        - happens at the lowest level of neurons
        - the mind is a product of brain processes

Materialism - replaced Dualism - there is only one substance *matter*
Idealism - there is only one substance *mind*

Neutral Monism - there is only one substance *material + spirtual*

4 questions that seperate these views
    1. Is mind a substance can it exist without anything material
    2. is matter a substance can it exist without the mind
        - YES YES = Dualism
        - YES NO = Materialism
        - NO YES = Idealism
        - NO NO = Neutral Monism

How many different substance are there?
    1 = monism
    2 = dualism
    Many = Pluralism

Monsim = materialist / idealism / neutral monism

Newtonian - particles and waves (accepted until 1920)
Replaced by Wave-Particle Duality - everything in nature has both properties (wave and copopular)
    - in reality we think we deal with wavicles

Newtonian Lawws = in any material process the same inital conditions always produce the same effects
    - same conditions -> same results

Dualistic Determinism
    - Cartesians and Newtonians
        - mind does not have any material
        - mind has free will and can create unintneded effects
        - out doing Newtons Laws

4 views on Causation
    1. Strict Determinism - everything has been pre-determined (it may appear free)
    2. Indeterminism - there can be uncaused events (spontaneous events)(infinite outcomes)
    3. Probablistic Determinism - for any set of inital conditions -> there are a *limited* amount of outcomes
    4. Dualistic Determinism - all events are deterministic, but the mind is free to act


Theology has dropped from our contemporary mosiac
    - current accepted view is agnosticism

open question of what replaced theology in our current mosaic
