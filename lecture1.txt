Lecture 01: An Introduction
==========================

- there are many myths surrounding scientific histories
- taught innapropiatley during high school
- 10 Myths

5 History Based
==============
1. Science began in the 17th century with the likes of Galileo and Newton
2. Galileo was a martyr of science who fought agaisnt the dogmatism of clergy
3. The scientific revolution liberated science from religion
4. It is accepted in the contemporary science that God does not exist
5. Contemporary sceicence is independant form any metaphysics

5 Philosophy Based
==================
1. Science proves its theories by experiments and observations
2. The method of science is universal and unchangeable
3. Science is a rational enterprise beacause of its universal method
4. Each succeeding scientific theory contains more and more true claims
5. There is a strict demarcation line between science and pseudoscience

History of Sciences options:
Option 1: Great Scientists Biographies of Individual Sciencentists
Option 2: Great Institutions: Oxford / UofT / Royal Society

The answer is neither!

*** SCIENTIFIC THEORIES ***
    - changes in the mosiac and contemporary theories
        - mosaic = the interconnecting between the sciences like chem/math/bio (social and natural sciences)
        - theory = any set of propositions
        - Scientific Mosaic is made of theories
        - and Scientific Change is defined by the mosaic (switching from one theory to the next)
        - pretty much whenever the mosaic gets modified
        - if you go back in time, different pecies fit into the puzzle, compared to our current day beliefs
            - like theology is apart of core ciriculum

Its safe to say the scientific mosaic changes from time period to time period

example: Apple falling from a Tree
==================================

1. Newtonian Physics = two objects, earth and apple both have mass and gravity pulls them together
2. Aristotelian Physics = Universe is 2 regions, Earth is the center, and all the planets revolve around the earth
    - when you reach the terrestrial region(earth and things around it)(made of 4 elements)
    - (Earth / Water) - heavy ==> things drop towards center of earth
    - (Air / Fire) - light ==> ascend
3. General Relativity (Einstein) - space around earth is curved due to its mass
- apple is seemingly attracted to the earth
-apple is in a state of inertial motion in a curved space

Goal of this example is to show how science evolves throughout history 

2 fundamental questions:

1. What was the Scientific Mosaic of a certain time?
2. What were the MAJOR transitions of the Mosaic?

What does Philosphy have to do with science?
============================================

Are there things in the Mosaic that are IMMUNE to change?

Questsion 1: Is there such a thing as absolute knowledge? 

Question 2: Scientific Method
What is the method of

Question 3: Scientific Change
What causes science theories to change

Question 4: Scientific Progress
When long term theories get denied later on are we really making any progress?

Question 5: Difference between science and psudoscience
Many once accepted theories are now classified as non-scientific or psudoscience
- like theology
- is there a clear cut line between these two sciences
