Lecture 8: Cartesian Worldview
==============================

accepted for only 40 years (very short period of time)
Decarte knew how to play the game, he played his methods to trick the community to like his methods

Cartesian Metaphysics = decartes's goal is to erase all theories
- doubt experience
- the world
- and even my own existance

and only accept things that are true

decartes "I exist" -> "god exists"
    - but why prove why god exists

God is all good and all knowing, Thus everything I precieve is true, what i precieve is from objects and must actually exists

Matter Exists
mind = thought
indispensible def of matter, occupying space

Mechanicism - material objects are bits of interacting matter
over took "Hylomorphism" - every compound can be analytically decompsed into its form and matter
    - counter arguement, doesnt really explain anything - dismantles hylomorphism that form doesnt exist

"Action By Contact"
    - replaces Teleology where all things tend towards certain intrinsic or extrinsic goals
    - Decrate claims things happen because of contact between bits (actual contact)
    - change can only be brough about through actual contact

Dualism - 2 substances
    - matter
    - mind

replaces Pluralism - there are many types of things each with a substantial form

Matter - things that occupy space and are systems of moving particles
Ideal World - is a different substance has nothing to do with particles

As humans we live in two worlds, the mind and the matter
    - there are things that are only mind (god)
    - animals and objects are ONLY matter (animals / rocks)

"What about gravity/magnitism?"

Matter is extension -> objects can only interact by contact
Decartes 1st Law - every part of matter maintins its state unless a collision appears
Decartes 2nd Law - every part of matter regarded by itself tends to continue along straight lines

Can there be empty space in this mechanic universe

Plenism - there can be no empty space

Motion exists = and is always circular, as you move through space things move since there is no empty space
    - an interchange of positions

Gravity - the inward pressure caused by the condensation of finer matter at the periphery of a vortex

Hypothetico Deductive Method
Experimental Method - allows for natual and artifical to exist together and legitimized accepting the results of experiements and observations
    - behavior in a cage is the similar to outside the cage

Qualitative vs Quantitative
    - mathematics is no longer confined to quantitative change
    - since all things are bits everything
    - Math: universial method
