Lecture 5 Scientific Progress
===============================

Are our scientific theories represented of the natural world
    - OR are they only reletive to what we can believe

Scientfic Realism = our science is accurate to the nature of the mind independant world
    - need to seperate acceptance and use, MUST have this distinction

Anti Scientfic Realism(Instrumentalists) = we are in no position to know whether we are correct or not
    - we cant really accept things, the only thing that remains is to use your theories

Two flavors of Reailism
    Structural Realism - new entities may appear/change yet, structures remain
        - even if theories in the future may be rejected, the equations will remain
    Entity Realizm - its the knowledge of relationships that is changing, our knowledge of entites will NEVER change. once we find them they will be in the mosaic forever

Does science always progress towards the truth?
    - we can nearly always claim the science progresses our understanding of reality
        - 2 camps yes, and no

Scientific Community = dont care themsleves about progress but whether they actully succeed in approximating the truth
    - there has been unquestionable progress between centuries
    - by advancing new hypotheses we gradually increase our ability to guess
    - but the world of phenomina cannot be completly disconnected to the outside world

No-Miracles Argument
    - science has been empirically successful
    - the world of phenomena is somehow affected by the external world
        - combined becomes the progress thesis, the explinations provided by science becomes increasingly accurate
    - since our theories become increasingly accurate and precise in their predictions that can only indicate that we gradually uncover the inner structure of the wolrd

Pessimistic Induction Argument
    - the ontologies of past theories are usually considered mistaken 
        No Progress Thesis - we can't know whether science progressss towards truth

    - the idea is like visual arts, that we proliferate ideas that are not strictly better or worse
    - we have reason to beleieve through gravyard of false ontologies, so we can learn towards that we science actually progresses towards the truth
