Lecture 4: Law of Scientific Change
===================================

Can there be a gerneral def/theory that desribes sci change

If Yes: Generalism 
If no: Particularism (what is generally accepted today)
    1. There is no universal and fixed method of science
    2. No universal features (no permenant fixtures)

Drug Testing 1: (anti-depressant)
    1. find people that suffer from the condition
    2. give them the drug
    YET
    Time has told that other factors have also played into getting better
        - how can you be sure unaccounted effects dont enter the picture
        - ANSWER: control trial

    2 groups: 1 gets drug, 1 doesnt
    Yet he is missing out on the placebo effect

    To answer that we get a blind trial
        - one group gets a fake pill

    experimenters bias - sub concious clues to the fake pill group
        - now you do no researchers

    A hypothetico deductive method -> lead to unaccounted effects -> lead to new kinds of experiments

Ex 2: Repeatability
    - issue is one time events
    - even the hypthetico deductive method relies on other theories
        - the idea that the way the world works,  is based on a complex inner mechanism
            - theory of complexity
        - next is the post hoc explanations
            - idea that everything can be explained again, equally precise
            - everyone might be smart after the fact
            - as long as it predicts something novel

Aristotelian-Medieval Method: Nature of Things, a thing as its nature an indispensable quality
    - acorns = oak trees, its indispensable quality
2nd an experieanced person, could grasp the nature of a thing(like the acorn)

    Only one thing is needed for a proposition in th eAristotelian-Medieval Method
        - acceptable if deductable, of the theories of the time
        - true for ALL cases of method of deployment

Scientific Change: the Laws
============================

0th Law: Compatability: at any moment of time, the elements of the mosiac are compatible with each other

Structure of a Method: has 3 components
    1. Acceptance Criteria (acceptable or not)
    2. Demarcation Criteria (scientfic or not)
    3. Compatatility Criteria (compatible or incompataible)

- Only one counter example is sufficient to counteract some theories
- often you will want to make sure that the counter example is true

emperical theories are not perfect
